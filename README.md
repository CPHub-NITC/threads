  Road Map to CP  
● Learn a programming language preferably Cpp.  
● Then learn builtin libraries and inbuilt functions(learn STL if C++)  
● Learn basic concepts like binary search, greedy algorithms and  
recursion,sorting algos etc.  
● Learn Basic Number Theory.  
● Start Problem solving at HackerRank.  
● Once you feel comfortable at solving, start participating in contests
going around.  
● Websites -> Codeforces.Codechef,Atcoder .  
● Practice from junior training sheet. [Sheet](https://goo.gl/unDETI)  
● Practice from codeforces problemset by sorting problems according  
to rating and descending order of number of submissions.  
● As you reach a higher tier start learning advanced data structures like
segment trees,trie etc.  
● Learn Graph theory .  
● There is a good playlist in youtube for graphs(CodeNCode)  
● Also after participating in contest try to solve at least one question
that you couldn't solve in contest(Upsolve)  
● And keep practicing to improve speed and accuracy,Solve problems
which are rated at least 100 above your current rating and don't
waste time on easier problems and try to solve problems which you
don't feel comfortable with.  
● If you can't solve a problem for more than 30 min then just read the
editorial (only practice in websites which provide good editorials.)and
Then try to implement the code yourselves and if you encounter any
new topic just google it and learn . Then practice problems on newly
learnt topics
