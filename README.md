  Road Map to CP  
### Ajay  
● Learn a programming language preferably Cpp.  
● Then learn builtin libraries and inbuilt functions(learn STL if C++)  
● Learn basic concepts like binary search, greedy algorithms and  
recursion,sorting algos etc.  
● Learn Basic Number Theory.  
● Start Problem solving at HackerRank.  
● Once you feel comfortable at solving, start participating in contests
going around.  
● Websites -> Codeforces.Codechef,Atcoder .  
● Practice from junior training sheet. [Sheet](https://goo.gl/unDETI)  
● Practice from codeforces problemset by sorting problems according  
to rating and descending order of number of submissions.  
● As you reach a higher tier start learning advanced data structures like
segment trees,trie etc.  
● Learn Graph theory .  
● There is a good playlist in youtube for graphs(CodeNCode)  
● Also after participating in contest try to solve at least one question
that you couldn't solve in contest(Upsolve)  
● And keep practicing to improve speed and accuracy,Solve problems
which are rated at least 100 above your current rating and don't
waste time on easier problems and try to solve problems which you
don't feel comfortable with.  
● If you can't solve a problem for more than 30 min then just read the
editorial (only practice in websites which provide good editorials.)and
Then try to implement the code yourselves and if you encounter any
new topic just google it and learn . Then practice problems on newly
learnt topics

  Road Map to CP  
  ### gautham227  
● Learn a basic programming language like c++ or python  
● Learn the basic DS and algo like basic math, number theory, binary search, greedy algorithm, recursion and backtracking.  
● These basic topics can be learned from the book “A guide to competitive programming” from Antti Laaksonen.  
● If more detailed theory is required then the website cp algorithms can be referred.  
● Basic problems from the learned topics can be done from the CSES problem set  
● For further practice, problems from hackerRank can be solved  
● Now we can start competing in contests from codeforces, codechef, atcoder, leetcode etc  
● To build our logic we can solve the problems from the problemset in codechef or codeforces according to the rating.  
● Advanced concepts like Segment tree, Binary indexed tree, Dynamic programming, Graph algorithms, Game theory, Geometric algorithms, Fast fourier transformation and heavy light decomposition should be learned after getting a grip on basic theory and problems.  
● If our rating is getting stagnant then we can solve questions according to rating from A2OJ  (preferably ones with rating 100 more than our present rating). 
Continue to participate in contests and if unable to solve particular problems just take hint from the editorial (do not go through the complete solutions) and try to solve them again if still solve it go through the solution and also practice some problems of similar logic.  
● If we find any new topics then learn it from the various online sources.  
● Just keep on practicing and continue to participate in contests as “PRACTICE MAKES A MAN PERFECT”.  
● Never take it as a job and just enjoy the process.
